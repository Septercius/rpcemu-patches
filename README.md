# rpcemu-patches
This repository contains the source code for various patches for RPCEmu.  These are as follows:

## Base

This is the main Mac patch, which provides keyboard support, amongst other things.

## MagicKeys

This is an addition to the main Mac patch, which changes the magic key combination for exiting from mouse capture mode from Ctrl+End to Ctrl+Command.  This is mainly intended for Mac laptop users, who do not have a dedicated "End" key.
